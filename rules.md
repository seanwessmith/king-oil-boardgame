# King Oil

## Goal

Be the last player standing financially (or, if the bank runs out of money, have the highest total value). The winner is crowned **King Oil**.

---

## 1. Game Overview

**King Oil** is a turn-based drilling and investment game.

Players:

* Buy oil-field properties
* Drill for oil in hidden wells
* Build derricks to collect royalties
* Install pipelines to siphon royalties from opponents

Win by bankrupting opponents or amassing the most wealth when the bank runs dry.

---

## 2. Components

* **Game Board**

  * Properties map with prices
  * Three hidden drilling-result discs (reset each game)

* **Parts Box** (per player)

  * Colored derricks (for producing wells)
  * Well caps (dry holes)
  * Pipelines
  * Sheds (un-drilled property ownership)

* **Wildcat Cards** (32 total)

  * Determine royalties, drilling limits, property purchases
  * Two special "Fire" cards (only two sections)
  * Reshuffle when exhausted

* **Money**

  * Starting cash: **\$80,000**

    * Four \$500 bills
    * Eight \$1,000 bills
    * Four \$5,000 bills
    * Five \$10,000 bills
  * Remaining cash in bank (one player acts as banker)

---

## 3. Setup

1. Give each player a Parts Box and \$80,000.
2. Shuffle Wildcat cards; place face-down.
3. Choose starting properties (in turn order):

   * Each player buys one property, pays the bank, and places a shed.
4. Set drilling discs:

   * Randomly turn discs until they "click". Positions remain fixed for the game.

---

## 4. Turn Sequence

1. **Determine First Player**:

   * Highest bidder on first property goes first (ties: next highest, then clockwise).

2. **On Your Turn**:

   1. Draw a Wildcat card.
   2. Follow card instructions top to bottom (Fire cards have two sections).
   3. Handle royalties, drilling, and optional property purchase.
   4. Turn ends after all sections completed or forced stop due to penalties.

---

## 5. Wildcat Card Sections

Each card (except Fire) has three sections:

1. **Top (Royalties)**:

   * Receive payment from bank for each producing well.

2. **Center (Drilling)**:

   * Max wells allowed this turn.
   * Must drill at least one well (except Fire cards).
   * Announce intended number of wells before drilling.

3. **Bottom (Property Purchase)**:

   * Option to buy one additional property (not mandatory).

### Fire Cards

* Only Top and Center sections.
* No drilling; remove specified derricks, replace with well caps.

## 6. Drilling for Oil

1. Place rig stem into empty hole on owned property.
2. Drop flat to reveal hidden disc colors:

| Colors Exposed | Result           | Cost    | Action                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| 0              | Dry hole         | \$6,000 | Pay bank; cap hole      |
| 1              | Deep oil         | \$6,000 | Pay bank; place derrick |
| 2              | Medium-level oil | \$4,000 | Pay bank; place derrick |
| 3              | Shallow oil      | \$2,000 | Pay bank; place derrick |

> **Note**: Productive wells remain active unless removed by fire.

---

## 7. Pipelines

Pipelines collect royalties from opponents:

1. **Prerequisites**:

   * Minimum 4 derricks on a property to build first pipeline.
   * +1 derrick per additional pipeline from same property.

2. **Cost**: \$25,000 each.

3. **Placement**: Across adjacent property boundaries.

4. **Limit**: Max 3 pipelines from one property.

5. **Royalties**: Collected at start of opponent’s turn:

| Pipelines to One Opponent | Royalty per Opponent Derrick |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1 pipeline                | \$1,000                      |
| 2 pipelines               | \$3,000                      |
| 3 pipelines               | \$5,000                      |

6. **Removal**:

   * Pipelines fixed in place.
   * Remove if insufficient derricks remain.

---

## 8. Running Short of Cash

* Bankruptcy occurs if unable to pay debts (properties auctioned).
* May drill if cash < \$6,000 (last chance).
* Selling properties allowed (mutual agreement only).

---

## 9. Bankruptcy & Auctions

* Bankrupt player eliminated.
* Properties auctioned in \$500 increments.
* Winner assumes obligations, collects royalties.
* Unsold properties close permanently.

---

## 10. Penalties

* **Drilling on another’s property**: Pay drilling cost, leave markers.
* **Drilling unowned property**: Pay cost + \$10,000 fine, lose turn. Claim property next turn if unchallenged.
* **Forced drilling (no empty holes)**: Pay \$10,000 per forced drill.
* **Drilling without card**: \$6,000 per hole, cap holes, end turn.
* **Exceeding drill limit**: \$6,000 per hole, cap holes, lose next turn.

---

## 11. Winning the Game

* **Immediate win**: Last solvent player becomes King Oil.
* **Bank runs dry**: Players calculate totals:

  * Property values
  * Producing wells (\$4,000 each)
  * Pipelines (\$25,000 each)
  * Cash on hand
* Highest total wins.

---

## 12. Pipeline Installation Examples

(Refer to cover diagrams for visuals.)

* 3 pipelines to 3 different adjacent properties: \$1,000 per derrick.
* 2 pipelines A→B: \$3,000/derrick; 1 pipeline A→C: \$1,000/derrick.
* All 3 pipelines to one property A→D: \$5,000/derrick.
* Two origins into one property: \$1,000/derrick each.
* Mutual pipelines (different origins): \$1,000/derrick to each other.
